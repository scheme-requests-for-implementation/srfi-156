<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>The power and universality of the prefix notation employed by Scheme
  and other dialects of Lisp can be intimidating. However, we find that
  there are occasions when prefix syntax can be confusing and lead to
  code that is not self-documenting. We have identified that one of such
  cases is the use of asymmetrical binary predicates.</p>

<p>Probably the most common examples are the numerical comparison
  predicates <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>
  and <code>&gt;</code>. It is non obvious, for instance, how the expression
  <code>(&lt; a b)</code> should be pronounced.</p>

<p>The problem gets more serious in the case of user-defined binary
  predicates. For example, in the expression <code>(divides? x y)</code>
  the role of arguments is unclear: we don't know whether the author
  of the <code>divides?</code> predicate intended it to check whether
  <code>x</code> divides <code>y</code> or whether <code>y</code>
  divides <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>And while there seems to exist a silent convention among Schemers
  to interpret predicates like <code>(has-something-to? x y)</code>
  as "<code>x</code> has something to <code>y</code>", we believe
  that this convention should be made explicit, and confirmed by
  the forms available in the language.</p>

<p>We therefore propose a thin layer of "syntactic stevia" that can
  be implemented using regular Scheme macros. We suggest, that the
  code <code>(is x &lt; y)</code> should be transformed
  to <code>(&lt; x y)</code>, and <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z)</code>
  -- to <code>(and (&lt; x y) (&lt;= y z))</code>. In addition, we
  suggest special meaning to the <code>_</code> symbol:
  <code>(is _ &lt; y)</code> and <code>(is x &lt; _)</code>
  should be transformed to <code>(lambda (_) (&lt; _ y))</code>
  and <code>(lambda (_) (&lt x _))</code>, respectively.
  This SRFI document also describes some other uses of the
  <code>is</code> macro and its limitations.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

??? Optional section that may point out things to be resolved.  This
will not appear in the final SRFI.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>In <i>Evolution of Lisp</i> Richard Gabriel and Guy Steele wrote:

<blockquote>
  The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps
  popping up and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy
  between those who find the universal use of S-expressions a technical
  advantage (and donâ€™t mind the admitted relative clumsiness of
  S-expressions for numerical expressions) and those who are certain
  that algebraic syntax is more concise, more convenient, or even
  more natural (whatever that may mean, considering that all these
  notations are artificial).
</blockquote>

However, even though the language of mathematics is an artificial
invention of our civilization, there is a tradition of calling our
spoken ethnic languages <i>natural</i>.</p>

<p>Ethnic languages usually allow to express certain binary relations
  using a sort of infix syntax. We can say, for example,
  "John <i>is taller than</i> Tom", "Joe <i>is in love with</i> Jane"
  and so on.</p>

<p>Note that the order in which the elements appear in the sentence
  is crucial: even if Joe is in love with Jane, it need not be the
  case that Jane is in love with John; if John is taller than Tom,
  then it is reasonable to expect that Tom is not taller than John.</p>

<p>It should be apparent that the prefix notation employed by the
  Scheme programming language obscures the roles of specific
  objects from the relation. In the expression
  <code>(taller-than? John Tom)</code> it is unclear whether we mean
  that John is taller than Tom or the other way around.</p>

<p>Although we could in principle employ a consistent convention
  regarding the roles of arguments in such relations (and this has
  indeed been the case so far), the power of Scheme programming
  language allows us to go beyond a mere convention. In particular,
  we can extend Scheme with a syntactic form which embodies this
  convention.</p>

<h2>Infix relations</h2>

<p>This document proposes to augment Scheme with a new syntactic
  form, <code>is</code>, so that, for example, the expression
  <code>(is John taller-than? Tom)</code> is expanded to
  <code>(taller-than? John Tom)</code>.</p>

<p>In addition improved code readability, the introduction
  of the <code>is</code> form gives an occasion to provide
  some convenient special behaviour in some particular cases.
  While some Schemers may find the lack of regularity
  and predictability of the <code>is</code> form repulsive,
  we believe that it actually allows to express some common
  operations more succinctly.</p>

<h2>Short-hand lambda expressions</h2>

<p>For example, we decided to treat the <code>_</code> (underscore)
  symbol differently than other symbols. <code>(is _ taller-than? John)</code>
  is expanded to <code>(lambda (_) (taller-than? _ John))</code>,
  thereby making the functionality of the <code>is</code> form
  partially overlap with the <code>cut</code> special form defined
  in the SRFI 26 document.</p>

<p>We chose the underscore symbol, although the <code>cut</code>
  macro uses the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> symbol, because it has been
  used as a special non-bindable symbol in various pattern matchers
  for Scheme (as well as in the Prolog language). It has also
  traditionally been used to name values that are meant to be
  ignored, so we believe that our choice should not be in conflict
  with existing practices.</p>

<h2>Handling more arguments</h2>
    
<p>If the <code>is</code> macro is used with more than three arguments,
  we require that the number of arguments is odd, and every second
  argument is a binary predicate. In such case, the macro expands
  to a conjunction of conditions, in a way that is often used by
  mathematicians. For example,
  <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z &lt; w)</code> expands to
  <code>(and (&lt; x y) (&lt;= y z) (&lt; z w))</code>.
</p>

<h2>Handling less arguments</h2>

<p>The <code>is</code> macro could technically also be passed less than
  three arguments. Although we could rule out such usages by raising
  a syntax error, it makes sense to overload the <code>is</code> operator
  to behave meaningfully.</p>

<p>The single argument case expands to a predicate that checks whether
  its argument is <code>equal?</code> to the argument to the <code>is</code>
  macro. For example, <code>(is '(1 2 3))</code> expands to
  <code>(lambda (x) (equal? x '(1 2 3)))</code>. This case is therefore
  effectively equivalent to <code>(is _ equal? '(1 2 3))</code>.</p>

<p>The two argument case isn't particularly useful: <code>(is x even?)</code>
  simply expands to <code>(even? x)</code>. For consistency we also require
  that <code>(is _ even?)</code> simply expands to <code>even?</code>.</p>

<h2>Negation</h2>

<p>In addition to the <code>is</code> form, this SRFI provides an implementation
  of the <code>isnt</code> form, which negates the behavior of <code>is</code>.
  Although we didn't find that form particularly useful, we are certain that
  it may find its use, and if it were absent from the language, Schemers would
  come up with their own implementations. As a matter of fact, in our experiments
  with parroting the English language, we initially used the <code>isn't</code>
  symbol, which failed to work on some implementations.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>The exact and precise specification in terms of <code>syntax-rules</code>
  is given in the <b>Implementation</b> section. This section contains
  some remarks which explain some use cases that are intentionally meant
  to be unspecified.</p>

<h2>Multiple instances of underscore symbol</h2>

<p>There are at least two possible interpretations of the expression
  <code>(is _ related-to? _)</code>: it could either be understood
  as a predicate which checks whether an object is related to itself,
  i.e. <code>(lambda (_) (related-to? _ _))</code>, or as a notation
  equivalent to the plain <code>related-to?</code> function.</p>

<p>Since none of these interpretations is clearly better than the other,
  we discourage such uses of the language and leave the actual behavior
  unspecified. In particular, implementations may report syntax error
  when they detect such use cases.</p>

<h2>Underscore in the position of a later argument</h2>

<p>This document only specifies the treatment of underscore in the
  position of the first and the second argument to the predicate. However,
  since we allow the <code>is</code> macro to accept more arguments,
  it could in principle make sense to interpret usages like
  <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= _)</code> as <code>lambda</code>
  forms.</p>

<p>The problem with such cases is that they complicate the implementation
  for the sake of something that cannot be considered a good coding practice.
  So while it is fine for the implementers to cover this use case, we
  discourage the users from using the <code>is</code> form in such
  a way, and therefore leave this behavior unspecified.</p>

<h2>Other use cases</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to abuse the <code>is</code> macro, and come up
with usages such as <code>(map (is _ + 1) '(1 2 3))</code>. We discourage
such practice and advocate to limit the application of the <code>is</code>
macro to binary and unary predicates and equality checking.</p>

<h2>The lack of infix definitions</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to extend the infix syntax cover not only usages,
but also definitions of binary predicates. For example, one could wish
to write

<pre>
  (define/infix (is x divisible-by? y)
    (zero? (modulo x y)))
</pre>

This SRFI does not provide anything like the <code>define/infix</code>
form, as we do not think it is such a good idea. (However, modifying the
behavior of the <code>define</code> form to check whether its first argument
is <code>is</code> would be a much worse idea.)</p>

<p>We believe that in the definition context it's best to leave the
  roles of arguments to the convention that has been uttered in this SRFI.</p>

<h2>Relation to other SRFIs</h2>

<h3>SRFI 105 Curly-infix-expressions</h3>

<p>Some people may argue that the problem this SRFI is trying to address
  can be solved by applying the solution provided by
  the curly-infix-expressions.</p>

<p>However, we find the change proposed by the SRFI 105 very invasive
  and feel that their authors failed to provide the right justification
  for their idea. In particular, they didn't notice the difference between
  infix used with binary predicates and infix used for algebraic operations.</p>

<p>While we do not deny that infix syntax for algebraic formulas has its value,
  this value manifests itself mainly in the context of mathematical inquiries
  and education (for example, to explain the concepts of commutativity
  and associativity), and the context of software creation exposes
  different characteristics.</p>

<h3>SRFI 26 Notation for Specializing Parameters Without Currying</h3>

<p>The behavior of the <code>is</code> macro in the presence of the
  underscore symbol resembles the use of the <code>cut</code> macro.
  According to our investigation, the use of the <code>cut</code> macro
  to specialize one of arguments of a binary predicate accounts for some
  of its most common usages.</p>

<p>While we appreciate the mathematical insight which allows to perceive
  fixing specific arguments as making cuts through some multi-dimensional
  domains, we claim that from the point of view of program comprehension,
  this insight is usually an irrelevant detail.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

The implementation consists of three macros. The <code>infix</code> macro
is a helper macro and is not intended to be used directly. The <code>is</code>
and <code>isnt</code> macros were described in depth in previous sections.

<pre>
(define-syntax infix
  (syntax-rules () 
    ((_ x related-to? y)
     (related-to? x y))
    ((_ x related-to? y . likewise)
     (and (infix x related-to? y)
	  (infix y . likewise)))))

(define-syntax is 
  (syntax-rules (_)
    ((is _ related-to? right . likewise)
     (lambda (_)
       (infix _ related-to? right . likewise)))
    
    ((is left related-to? _ . likewise)
     (lambda (_)
       (infix left related-to? _ . likewise)))
    
    ((is x related-to? y . likewise)
     (infix x related-to? y . likewise))

    ((is x)
     (lambda (y)
       (equal? x y)))

    ((is _ predicate?)
     predicate?)
    
    ((is item predicate?)
     (predicate? item))))

(define-syntax isnt
  (syntax-rules (_)
    ((isnt x)
     (lambda (y)
       (not (equal? x y))))

    ((isnt _ predicate?)
     (lambda (_) (not (predicate? _))))
    
    ((isnt x predicate?)
     (not (predicate? x)))
    
    ((isnt _ related-to? right . likewise)
     (lambda (_)
       (not (infix _ related-to? right . likewise))))
    
    ((isnt left related-to? _ . likewise)
     (lambda (_)
       (not (infix left related-to? _ . likewise))))

    ((isnt x related-to? y . likewise)
     (not (infix x related-to? y . likewise)))))
</pre>
