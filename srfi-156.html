<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Recognizing binary predicates as a specific area
  in which the use of prefix operators is an impediment,
  we propose a thin layer of "syntactic stevia" for in-fixing
  such predicates. It can be implemented using regular Scheme
  macros. We suggest that the code <code>(is x &lt; y)</code> should
  be transformed to <code>(&lt; x y)</code>, and <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z)</code>
  -- to <code>(let ((y* y)) (and (&lt; x y*) (&lt;= y* z)))</code>.
  In addition, we suggest special meaning to the <code>_</code> symbol:
  <code>(is _ &lt; y)</code> and <code>(is x &lt; _)</code>
  should be transformed to <code>(lambda (_) (&lt; _ y))</code>
  and <code>(lambda (_) (&lt; x _))</code>, respectively.
  This SRFI document also describes some other uses of the
  <code>is</code> macro and its limitations.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The power and universality of the prefix notation employed by Scheme
  and other dialects of Lisp can be intimidating. We find that
  there are occasions when prefix syntax can be confusing and lead to
  code that is not self-documenting. We have identified that one of areas
  is the use of asymmetrical binary predicates.</p>

<p>Probably the most common examples are the numerical comparison
  predicates <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>
  and <code>&gt;</code>. It is non obvious, for instance, how the expression
  <code>(&lt; a b)</code> should be pronounced.</p>

<p>The problem gets more serious in the case of user-defined binary
  predicates. For example, in the expression <code>(divisor? x y)</code>
  the role of arguments is unclear: we don't know whether the author
  of the <code>divisor?</code> predicate intended it to check whether
  <code>x</code> is a divisor of <code>y</code> or whether <code>y</code>
  is a divisor of <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>And while there seems to exist a silent convention among Schemers
  to interpret predicates like <code>(has-something-to? x y)</code>
  as "<code>x</code> has something to <code>y</code>", we believe
  that this convention should be made explicit, and confirmed by
  the forms available in the language.</p>

<p>In <i>Evolution of Lisp</i> Richard Gabriel and Guy Steele wrote:

<blockquote>
  The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps
  popping up and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy
  between those who find the universal use of S-expressions a technical
  advantage (and donâ€™t mind the admitted relative clumsiness of
  S-expressions for numerical expressions) and those who are certain
  that algebraic syntax is more concise, more convenient, or even
  more natural (whatever that may mean, considering that all these
  notations are artificial).
</blockquote>

However, even though the language of mathematics is an artificial
invention of our civilization, there is a tradition of calling our
spoken ethnic languages <i>natural</i>.</p>

<p>Ethnic languages usually allow us to express certain binary relations
  using a sort of infix syntax. We can say, for example,
  "John <i>is taller than</i> Tom", "Joe <i>is in love with</i> Jane"
  and so on.</p>

<p>Note that the order in which the elements appear in the sentence
  is crucial: even if Joe is in love with Jane, it need not be the
  case that Jane is in love with John; if John is taller than Tom,
  then it is reasonable to expect that Tom is not taller than John.</p>

<p>It should be apparent that the prefix notation employed by the
  Scheme programming language obscures the roles of specific
  objects from the relation. In the expression
  <code>(taller-than? John Tom)</code> it is unclear whether we mean
  that John is taller than Tom or the other way around.</p>

<p>Although we could in principle employ a consistent convention
  regarding the roles of arguments in such relations (and this has
  indeed been the case so far), the power of Scheme programming
  language allows us to go beyond a mere convention. In particular,
  we can extend Scheme with a syntactic form which embodies this
  convention.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Infix relations</h2>

<p>This document proposes to augment Scheme with a new syntactic
  form, <code>is</code>, so that, for example, the expression
  <code>(is John taller-than? Tom)</code> is expanded to
  <code>(taller-than? John Tom)</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to improved code readability, the introduction
  of the <code>is</code> form gives an occasion to provide
  some convenient special behaviour in some particular cases.
  While some Schemers may find the lack of regularity
  and predictability of the <code>is</code> form repulsive,
  we believe that it actually allows us to express some common
  operations more succinctly.</p>

<h2>Short-hand lambda expressions</h2>

<p>For example, we decided to treat the <code>_</code> (underscore)
  symbol differently than other symbols. <code>(is _ taller-than? John)</code>
  is expanded to <code>(lambda (_) (taller-than? _ John))</code>,
  thereby making the functionality of the <code>is</code> form
  partially overlap with the <code>cut</code> special form defined
  in the SRFI 26 document.</p>

<p>We chose the underscore symbol, although the <code>cut</code>
  macro uses the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> symbol, because it has been
  used as a special non-bindable symbol in various pattern matchers
  for Scheme (as well as in the Prolog language). It has also
  traditionally been used to name values that are meant to be
  ignored, so we believe that our choice should not be in conflict
  with existing practices.</p>

<p>However, the <code>_</code> symbol should not be bound to
  a new transformer, but instead it should be imported from
  <code>(scheme base)</code> and re-exported, so that it can
  be renamed by the users who prefer to stick with the
  <code>&lt;&gt;</code> symbol from SRFI-26.</p>

<h3>Multiple instances of underscore</h3>

<p>If more than one instance of the underscore symbol appears
  in the argument position of the <code>is</code> and <code>isnt</code>
  macros, each occurrence counts as a separate argument (increasing
  the arity of the resulting lambda accordingly). For example,
  <code>(is _ &lt; _)</code> is equivalent to
    <code>(lambda (_1 _2) (&lt; _1 _2))</code>.
</p>

<h2>Negation</h2>

<p>In addition to the <code>is</code> form, this SRFI provides an implementation
  of the <code>isnt</code> form, which negates the behavior of <code>is</code>.
  Although we didn't find that form particularly useful, we are certain that
  it may find its use, and if it were absent from the language, Schemers would
  come up with their own implementations. As a matter of fact, in our experiments
  with parroting the English language, we initially used the <code>isn't</code>
  symbol, which failed to work on some implementations.</p>

<h2>Handling fewer arguments</h2>

<p>The <code>is</code> and <code>isnt</code> macros could technically
  be passed fewer than three arguments. In particular, we interpret
  <code>(isnt x prime?)</code> as <code>(not (prime? x))</code>,
  and <code>(isnt _ prime?)</code> as
  <code>(lambda (_) (not (prime? _)))</code>. For consistency,
  we interpret the usages of the <code>is</code> macro similarly,
  although it may not seem particularly useful.</p>

<p>It is illegal to use the <code>is</code> and <code>isnt</code>
  macros with fewer than two arguments, and such attempts should
  raise a syntax error.</p>

<h2>Handling more arguments</h2>
    
<p>If the <code>is</code> macro is used with more than three arguments,
  then every second argument must be a predicate. In such case, the macro expands
  to a conjunction of conditions, in a way that is often used by
  mathematicians. For example,
  <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z &lt; w finite?)</code> expands to
  <pre>
    (let ((y* y))
      (and (&lt; x y*)
           (let ((z* z))
             (and (&lt;= y* z*)
                  (let ((w* w))
                    (and (&lt; z* w*)
                         (finite? w*)))))))
  </pre>
  where <code>y*</code>, <code>z*</code> and <code>w*</code>
  are <i>hygienic identifiers</i> (i.e. they are guaranteed not to shadow
  any existing bindings).
</p>

<h2>Other use cases</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to abuse the <code>is</code> macro, and come up
with usages such as <code>(map (is _ + 1) '(1 2 3))</code>. We discourage
such practice and advocate to limit the application of the <code>is</code>
macro to binary and unary predicates and equality checking.</p>

<h2>The lack of infix definitions</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to extend the infix syntax cover not only usages,
but also definitions of binary predicates. For example, one could wish
to write

<pre>
  (define/infix (is x divisible-by? y)
    (zero? (modulo x y)))
</pre>

This SRFI does not provide anything like the <code>define/infix</code>
form, as we do not think it is such a good idea. (However, modifying the
behavior of the <code>define</code> form to check whether its first argument
is <code>is</code> would be a much worse idea.)</p>

<p>We believe that in the definition context it's best to leave the
  roles of arguments to the convention that has been uttered in this SRFI.</p>

<h2>Relation to other SRFIs</h2>

<h3>SRFI 105 Curly-infix-expressions</h3>

<p>Some people may argue that the problem this SRFI is trying to address
  can be solved by applying the solution provided by
  the curly-infix-expressions.</p>

<p>However, we find the change proposed by the SRFI 105 very invasive
  and feel that their authors failed to provide the right justification
  for their idea. In particular, they didn't notice the difference between
  infix used with binary predicates and infix used for algebraic operations.</p>

<p>While we do not deny that infix syntax for algebraic formulas has its value,
  this value manifests itself mainly in the context of mathematical inquiries
  and education (for example, to explain the concepts of commutativity
  and associativity), and the context of software creation exposes
  different characteristics.</p>

<h3>SRFI 26 Notation for Specializing Parameters Without Currying</h3>

<p>The behavior of the <code>is</code> macro in the presence of the
  underscore symbol resembles the use of the <code>cut</code> macro.
  According to our investigation, the use of the <code>cut</code> macro
  to specialize one of arguments of a binary predicate accounts for some
  of its most common usages.</p>

<p>While we appreciate the mathematical insight which allows us to perceive
  fixing specific arguments as making cuts through some multi-dimensional
  domains, we claim that from the point of view of program comprehension,
  this insight is usually an irrelevant detail.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

The implementation consists of five macros. The <code>infix/posix</code>,
<code>extract-placeholders</code> and <code>identity-syntax</code> are helper macros
and are not intended to be used directly. The <code>is</code>
and <code>isnt</code> macros were described in depth in the previous section.

<pre>
  (define-syntax infix/postfix
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((infix/postfix x somewhat?)
       (somewhat? x))

      ((infix/postfix left related-to? right)
       (related-to? left right))

      ((infix/postfix left related-to? right . likewise)
       (let ((right* right))
         (and (infix/postfix left related-to? right*)
              (infix/postfix right* . likewise))))))

  (define-syntax extract-placeholders
    (syntax-rules (_)
      ((extract-placeholders final () () body)
       (final (infix/postfix . body)))

      ((extract-placeholders final () args body)
       (lambda args (final (infix/postfix . body))))

      ((extract-placeholders final (_ op . rest) (args ...) (body ...))
       (extract-placeholders final rest (args ... arg) (body ... arg op)))

      ((extract-placeholders final (arg op . rest) args (body ...))
       (extract-placeholders final rest args (body ... arg op)))

      ((extract-placeholders final (_) (args ...) (body ...))
       (extract-placeholders final () (args ... arg) (body ... arg)))

      ((extract-placeholders final (arg) args (body ...))
       (extract-placeholders final () args (body ... arg)))))

  (define-syntax identity-syntax
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((identity-syntax form)
       form)))

  (define-syntax is
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((is . something)
       (extract-placeholders identity-syntax something () ()))))

  (define-syntax isnt
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((isnt . something)
       (extract-placeholders not something () ()))))
